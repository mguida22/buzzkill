# clickbait-block

A google chrome extension to change clickbait titled articles. No more distracting links on Facebook or anywhere else!

### TODO

This (kind of) works right now but it's super slow and needs many improvements.

 - [ ] faster matching
 - [ ] match a wider variety of phrases
 - [ ] match links to sites such as buzzfeed, clickhole, upworthy, etc.
 - [ ] generate replacement titles
 - [ ] add icon and publish to chrome store
 - [ ] update when page changes

Note: There is an existing extension called [downworthy](https://github.com/snipe/downworthy) which does a nice job but the project has been inactive for a while and I have some different ideas for this project.
